FlickSage is a cinematic-themed movie recommendation system built with React.js and Vite.
It features a dynamic movie grid, genre-based filtering, and glowing neon-style visuals.
The UI includes a red neon title effect, hover animations for movie posters, and smooth transitions. 
Users can click on a movie to view its trailer and summary on a separate page. 
API keys are securely managed via .env files. The project uses React Router for navigation and Axios 
for fetching data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
FlickSage delivers an immersive experience, blending sleek design with seamless functionality.
